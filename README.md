GFMM
====


OVERVIEW
--------

This code provides an implementation of the research paper:

```
  Geodesic Finite Mixture Models
  E. Simo-Serra, C. Torras, and F. Moreno-Noguer
  British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC), 2014
```

and improvements provided in

```
  3D Human Pose Tracking Priors using Geodesic Mixture Models
  E. Simo-Serra, C. Torras, and F. Moreno-Noguer
  International Journal of Computer Vision, 2016
```

This allows clustering of data that is located on a known Riemannian manifold. Some highlights of the algorithm:

* Generative model
* Fully unsupervised
* Scales to large data

Installation
------------

The visualization code is dependent on Stefan Sommer's "smanifold" code. This can be found at https://github.com/nefan/smanifold . Once it is installed, edit the path in startup.m to point to the path in which this code is installed. As the rest of the code is pure matlab, there is no need to compile nor install anything else.


Usage
-----

There are two main files for the approach:

* gfmm.m -- Performs the model estimation
* gfmm_sample.m -- Performs sampling on the model

Additionally some demos are provided in demos/:

* sphere.m -- Synthetic sphere example.
* quad_surface.m -- Quadratic surface example. Very slow to compute as there are no closed forms for the exponential and logarithmic map operators.
* comparison.m -- Compares our model (GFMM) with von Mises-Fischer distributions and using a single tangent plane.

These demos reproduce several of the results in the paper. They were all run with "MATLAB R2012a (7.14.0.739) 64-bit (glnxa64)" and used a fixed seed for the random number generator to be deterministic. On different set-ups they may give different results.

In order to see results fast it is recommended to try the sphere demo as following:

```
>> sphere
```

You should get some output as follows:

```
 Initial distributions set up in 0.0 seconds
 Cnz=30, t=1 => 3.755e+02 <? 4.159e-03  (L=4.068e+03) in 0.4 secs

 Cnz=30, t=6 => 9.567e+01 <? 3.636e-03  (L=3.820e+03) in 0.5 secs
 Cnz=30, t=7 => 1.207e+02 <? 3.540e-03  (L=3.697e+03) in 0.5 secs
 ...
```

Additionally some figures will show results and progress.
